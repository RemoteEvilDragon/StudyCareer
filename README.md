## Kernel Confusing Concepts:
### Spatial regularity
>Most generative and discriminative segmentation approaches exploit **spatial regularity**,
often with extensions along the temporal dimension for longitudinal tasks.
### Conditional random fileds(MRF)
>Similarly,conditional random fields(CRF) help enforce --or prohibit-- the adjacency of wider 
spatial content of voxels.
